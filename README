=head1 DESCRIPTION

Games::Messages returns random messages for common situations in
games.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

There are eight functions available, suitable for different
situations.

There are functions for situations where a computer interacts with a
human player. However, if your computer player has a name, you might
consider using instead the function I<player_beats_player>, passing as
parameters the name of the winning player (which might be human or
not) and the defeated player (likewise).

Messages returned are meant as direct speech directed to the human
player (that is, the person with the keyboard; yes, you). They might
not be suitable for anything else apart than showing them to that
person.

  # that prints something like "$player_name wins."

=head2 player_loses

Returns a message suitable for a player who has lost a game.

  print player_loses($player_name);
  # that prints something like "No more $player_name."

=head2 computer_beats_computer

defeated another computer player.

  # myself...'

=head2 computer_beats_player

  # $loser_name."

=head2 player_is_idle

Returns a message suitable to be shown to an idle user.

  # that prints something like 'Gone to the bathroom, uh?'

=head2 player_exagerates

  # turn me off?"

=item * More messages;

=item * Offensive messages;

=item * Perhaps a way to guarantee that messages don't repeat
themselves too fast? (that is, go through all messages before
repeating one?)
